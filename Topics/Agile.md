# Agile

**What is agile?** 

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.



1. **What is a sprint review?**

   Sprint review is informal discussion what went well during a sprint and opportunity to demonstrate working *product*.

2. **What are the different roles within a Scrum team?**

   Product owner - Key stakeholder who should have deep understanding of the product and communicates with both team and other stakeholder
   
   Scrum master – Ensures the team keeps to the values of scrum, facilities meetings and removes impediments.
   
   Development team – Effectively 3-9 people, decide how the work will be done, everyone is accountable for the team productivity. 

3. **What are the three pillars of Scrum?**

   1.  Transparency – everyone presents the facts as is and collectively collaborates for the common organization objectives. No on has a hidden agenda
   2. Inspection – Not done by inspector but by everyone on the scrum team. The inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practices. eg. Scrum review and retro.
   3. Adaptation is about continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve. 

4. **What are the 4 values of Agile?**

   1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

   2. Working software over comprehensive documentation 

   3. Collaboration with customer over contract negotiation 

   4. Responding to change over following a plan

      

5. **What is the Three Amigos approach to User story refinement?**

   Three amigos refers to the primary perspectives to examine an increment of work before (**business**), during (**development**), and after development (**testing**), where for example, a Business Analyst, developers, tester and go over each story in an informal kick-off session to give a common shared vision of what will be delivered and helps ensure that it is the voice of the team rather than just a single opinion. As well as helping to prevent domination by one area, the 3 Amigos helps communication between the disciplines and promotes understanding of:

   - Collaborative Requirements – What problem are we trying to solve;

   - Ready for Development Consensus – How might we build a solution to solve that problem;

   - Acceptance for Definition of Done – What is needed to get the story into “Done”.

     

6. **Why do some organisations prefer waterfall over agile?**

   Agile and Waterfall are two popular methods for organizing projects. Waterfall is **a more traditional approach to project management**, involving a linear flow. Agile, on the other hand, embraces an iterative process. Waterfall is best for projects with concrete timelines and well-defined deliverables.

   

7. **Name all the Scrum artefacts and what they are**

   Product Backlog - Contains all of the stories to be done to complete the entire product

   Sprint Backlog - Contains only the stories to be worked on in the current Sprint

   Increment - A piece of working software created in a Sprint. The sum of all increments forms the whole product.

   

8. **Name and describe all the Scrum ceremonies aka events**

   The Sprint

   - Planning and development work
   - Limited to 1 month (planning horizon)
   - No changes should be made that endanger the sprint goal

   Sprint Planning

   - What can be delivered in the upcoming sprint?
   - How will the work be done?
   - Limited to 8 hours for a month long Sprint or less if shorter Sprint

   Daily Scrum

   - Optimizing team collaboration
   - What did I do yesterday?
   - What will I do today?
   - Do I see any impediment?

   Sprint Review

   - Informal discussion about what was done during the sprint and to adapt the product backlog
   - Explain what has been done and what hasn’t
   - Demonstrate the working package
   - Review timeline, budget, capabilities.
   - Timeboxed to 4 hours for a month long Sprint or less if shorter Sprint

   

   Sprint Retrospective

   - Inspect how the last sprint went

   - Identify what went well and what needs improvements

   - Create plan for improvements

   - Timeboxed to 3 hours for a month long Sprint or less if shorter Sprint

     

9. **What is Acceptance Criteria?**

   Acceptance criteria let **you define when your user story is complete** and when a user story has all the functionality needed to meet your user's needs. They are a set of conditions a user story should satisfy to be considered as done.

   

10. **What makes a good Gherkin Script?**

    > A good Gherkin Script should state feature requirement so that everyone can intuitively understand them. Good Gherkin should improve team collaboration by clarifying behaviors you want to develop.
    >
    > ```gherkin
    >   Scenario: Search from the search bar
    >     Given a web browser is at the Google home page
    >     When the user enters "panda" into the search bar
    >     Then links related to "panda" are shown on the results page
    > ```

    

11. **What is D.O.R (Definition of Ready)?**

    Having a Definition of Ready means that stories must be immediately actionable. The Team must be able to determine what needs to be done and the amount of work required to complete the User Story

    

12. **What is D.O.D (Definition of Done)?**

    The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born. The Definition of Done (DoD) represents the organization's formal definition of quality for all Product Backlog Items (PBIs). If an organization does not have one, the Scrum team should set its own. The Definition of Done is the commitment contained within the Increment artifact. Think of the DoD as what the organization requires before it can deliver a PBI to the end user

    

13. **What are some agile SDLCs (not including scrum) and how do they work?**

    Scrum, Kanban, Extreme programing, TDD etc. many different “flavors”
    
    **Extreme Programming** (XP) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team.
    
    **Test Driven Development** (TDD) is software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed,
