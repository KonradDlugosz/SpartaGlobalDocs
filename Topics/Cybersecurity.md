### Introduction:

1. **What is cybersecurity ?** 

   Cyber security's core function is to protect the **devices** we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the **services** we access - both online and at work - from theft or damage.

   It's also about preventing unauthorized access to the vast amounts of **personal information** we store on these devices, and online.

2. **Cybersecurity Cube (McCumber Cube)**

   1. Desired goals : (CIA Triad)

      * Confidentiality : Unauthorized access is prevented 

      * Integrity : Data should not be modified
      * availability : Access should not be unavailable

   2. Data states : 

      * Storage : Data At Rest (DAR) Data is in storage
      * Transmission : Data In Transit (DIT) Transferring data between systems
      * Processing : performing operations on data in order to achieve desired objective. 

   3. Safeguards: 

      * Policy and practices : administrative controls/operations
      * Human factors: personnel 
      * Technology : software and hardware based solutions 

3. **Cybersecurity colors** 
   1. Blue Team (The Defenders) : responsible for defense of security, damage control and incident response. 
   2. Red Team (The Breakers/Attackers) : commissioned to perform "ethical hacking" on an organization.
   3. White Team (The Admins) : responsible for refereeing an engagement between a Red Team and mock attackers and Blu Team of actual defenders of their enterprise's use on information systems.  
   4. Yellow Team (The Builders) : responsible for developing the security system of an organization. 
   5. Many more .... Depends on context and organization. 

4. **Hackers**
   1. Black Hat Hackers - Attackers 
   2. White Hat Hackers - Ethical hackers, hacking with permission.
   3. Grey Hat Hackers - violate laws or typical ethical standards, but no malicious intent. 

5. **Testing**
   1. White box testing : All information on the system.
   2. Black box testing : No information on the system. 
   3. Grey box testing : Some information. eg network design. 
6. **Essential Terms**
   1. Asset: An asset is what we trying to protect.
   2. Vulnerability : A vulnerability is a weakness or gap in our protection efforts.
   3. Exploit : The way how hackers leverage vulnerabilities. 
   4. Threat : A threat is what we are trying to protect against.
   5. Risk : the intersection of assets, threats and vulnerabilities. 
7. **Causes of Vulnerabilities**
   1. Design and development errors 
   2. Poor system configuration 
   3. Human errors
   4. Connectivity : unsecure network like working for a café.
   5. Complexity : too many entry points in large and complex system. 
   6. Passwords : not strong passwords.
   7. User input : invalidated input can cause vulnerability, SQL injection
   8. Management : incorrect management could miss some important aspects of the systems. Delay to manage security can cause vulnerability,
   9. Lack of training to staff 
   10. Communication : Mobile users need to use secure network. For example VPN to connect to organization network.

8. **Cyber Attacks**

   1. Un-targeted cyber attacks : phishing attacks which can be targeted for millions of people. 
   2. Targeted cyber attacks : Specific attack for a company or individual. 

9. **Threat Actors**

   ​	*CYBER THREAT ACTOR > MOTIVATION* 

   1. National-states > Geo political 
   2. Cybercriminals > Profits 
   3. Hacktivists > Ideological 
   4. Terrorist groups > ideological violence 
   5. Thrill-seekers > satisfaction/ attention 
   6. Insider threats > discontent

10. **Cyber Threats** 

    1. Malware : malicious software 
    2. Spyware : form of malware that hides on devices providing real-time information. 
    3. Phishing attack : lure individuals to gain information 
    4. DDoS : aims to disrupt a computer network. Overload system. 
    5. Ransomware : from of malware that denies access to a computer system or data until a ransom is paid. 
    6. Zero day exploit : flaw that is unknow until it happens. 
    7. Advanced persistent threats : unauthorized user gains access to a system or network and remain there for some time. 
    8. Trojan : a backdoor to your system 
    9. Wiper attacks : form of malware to wipe hard drive
    10. Intellectual property theft 
    11. Theft of money : access to bank account 
    12. Data manipulation : aims to change data 
    13. Data destruction : attempts to delete data 
    14. Main in the middle attack : alters communication between two parties who believe they are communication with each other.
    15. Rogue software : malware disguised as real software 
    16. Unpatched software 
    17. Natural disaster
    18. Water holing : fake website 
    19. Spear- phishing : sending emails to targeted individual that could contain an attachment with malicious software
    20. Deploying a botnet : to deliver DDoS attack
    21. Subverting the supply chain : to attack equipment or software being delivered to the organization.
